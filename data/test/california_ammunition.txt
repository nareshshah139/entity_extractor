The great British comedian John Cleese wrote a comedy skit for the Monty Python's Flying Circus television show forty years ago. Called the Cheese Sketch, it involves a man (Cleese) walking into a cheese shop to buy some cheese.
With each request for a different type of cheese, the proprietor looks behind the counter and apologizes for being fresh out.
Not to be undone, the California Legislature passed a law requiring that handgun ammunition not be displayed, it was to remain hidden from public view. This, of course, put a California customer in the position of asking whether or not the proprietor carried a particular brand and caliber of ammunition, wherein he would have to check to see if he had any in stock.
The law also required that persons purchasing handgun ammunition be fingerprinted. As a result, online retailers of ammunition had stated they would stop selling to California customers, including the police.
The law, AB 962, which was to take effect on the First of February was struck down as unconstitutional Jan. 18 by a Superior Court judge who issued an injunction against its enforcement.
Unless and until an appellate court reverses the decision, this ludicrous law is dead.
On a related note, tomorrow marks the three month anniversary of the Nordyke v King hearing. The decision by the 9th Circuit Court of appeals has been anxiously awaited by gun rights lawyers, many of whom have cases stayed until the decision is released. The decision is expected to be released this week or next.
You may recall, that the first decision in 2009 held that the U.S. Supreme Court Heller decision applied to California, this was before a U.S. Supreme Court decision explicitly applied the Heller decision to California and to every other state and local government throughout the nation (McDonald decision).
The Nordyke decision was reviewed by the full 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in a rare en banc hearing, vacated and sent back to the lower hearing pending release of the McDonald decision, which was issued by the US Supreme Court last June. The initial decision was vacated because the Court did not allow the Nordyke's to argue their case on 2nd Amendment grounds. Despite that, the Court found that we do have the Second Amendment right to openly carry firearms in public, but large venues, such as the Alameda County Fairgrounds which holds 4,000 people are a "sensitive place" where firearms can be restricted.
In last October's hearing, the attorney for the Nordyke's argued that unless a place was an historically sensitive place where firearms were not allowed (like courtrooms), we have the right to openly carry a firearm in those places. 
Curiously, the Court had questioned the constitutionality of the ban on firearms in parking lots. Curious because the parking lots to the Fairgrounds are larger than the building where the gun shows took place.
Even if the 9th Circuit Court were to issue an identical decision to its 2009 finding, it would reaffirm our Second Amendment Right to openly carry firearms in public. A right which has already been affirmed in separate cases at the District and Appellate level in the 9th Circuit.
Something to consider the next time you hear someone tell you that the Second Amendment applies only to one's home.
If the 9th Circuit Court of appeals finds that a place must be an "historically sensitive place" before firearms can be restricted then it would invalidate all of California's existing gun laws in those places such as the 1995 California Gun Free School Zone Act and its Federal counterpart. Bans in parks, including the Hermosa Beach ban on carrying firearms on the beach would also be invalidated as would the Dockweiler Beach ban, both in Los Angeles County.
Redondo Beach also has a park ban but then again, they do not believe that either State or Federal law applies to them. Redondo Beach has declared the Galleria and Pier Shopping Centers to be off limits to the Open Carry of firearms under threat of illegal arrest.
I am anxiously awaiting to hear them argue that before a court.
